    "* Clone the class github repository to your computer, the one at https://github.com/gtrichards/PHYS_T480_F18/  (should already have done this).\n",
    "* Click the Github Classroom link you received via the mailing list. This will create a private github repository through which you'll be submitting your homeworks. Clone that repository to your computer.\n",
    "* Copy this notebook from the class github repository to your private homework submission repository. IMPORTANT: rename it to `<filename>-FirstLast.ipynb` once you copy it, where `<filename>` is the existing filename and `FirstLast` are your first and last name. Example: `PHYST480-F18-HW1-GordonRichards.ipynb`.\n",
    "* Solve problems #2, #3, and #4 by filling in the missing cells in the copied notebook.\n",

    "## Problem 3\n",
    "Repeat the problem 2, but now add to the Gaussian sample (concatenate arrays with `np.concatenate()`) \n",
    "another sample of 10,000 data values drawn from a `cauchy` distribution with\n",

    "Follow the example from the Central Limit Theorem cells in BasicStats2.ipynb and simulate the distribution of 1,000,000 $\\mathscr{N}(0,1)$ draws of $\\chi^2$ for `N=2` and `N=5`.  Overplot the theoretical pdf (it will help to use `scipy.special.gamma()`)."
